# Resume of Step 0
We recognised that our HR System is polluted by the Shred Kernel data.
As the Shared Kernel is Upstream and is used by other Downstream systems (like HR System) we are not allowed to modify it.
So, it's not possible for us to create behaviours in these shared objets and make this procedural code Object oriented.

# Step 1
Find a way to decouple the HR System from the Shared Kernel.
