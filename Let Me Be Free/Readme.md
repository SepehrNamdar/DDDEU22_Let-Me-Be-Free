This is an application to help HR to manage interviews.

The use cas we work on is to Schedule an Interview for a HR.

The rules of this use case are :
 - the HR System should find a Consultant who is available for the Interview Date
 - the Consultant should be more experienced than the Profile for which we need to Schedule an Interview
 - the Consultant should cover all skills mentioned in the Profile
 - if many Consultants Can Test with the Profile, the System will choose the first one
 - the HR System should also find an available Room for the Interview Date
